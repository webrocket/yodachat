YodaChat - To chat Master Yoda invites you!
===========================================

YodaChat is a simple example application to demonstrate how to use WebRocket 
(http://github.com/webrocket/webrocket) from ruby applications using the 
Kosmonaut gem (http://github.com/webrocket/kosmonaut.rb).

Getting started
---------------
Installation and usage is extremally simple. First start and configure your 
WebRocket instance:

    $ webrocket-admin add_vhost /yoda
    
Now copy `.env.sample` file to `.env` and replace its contents with your
configuration. If you're done, then load it:

    $ . .env
    
Install app dependencies using bundler:

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install
    
And start the app with foreman (http://github.com/ddollar/foreman):

    $ foreman start

Now you shall go to 'http://localhost:5000' and see an amazing yodachat
application powered by WebRocket's awesomness.
